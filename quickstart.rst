Quick Start Guide
=================

In order to get started with the ACCEPT Portal and its plug-ins, you should decide whether your profile corresponds to:

  1. an online community member who is interested in authoring textual content that is easier to understand by other community members and easier to translate into other languages
  2. an online community member who is interested in helping make previously translated content understandable (e.g. translated textual content that may have been automatically translated is likely to require some editing)
  3. an online community content or technology owner or manager who is interested in giving community members some assistance in editing textual content (either original or translated content) or who is interested in collecting ratings for translated content.


If you belong to the first category and are somewhat proficient in English, French or German, you may want to:

  * go to the :ref:`preEditDemos` section to familiarise yourself with the ACCEPT online |pre| demos which show how the |pre| plug-in can easily be used to make your textual content easier to understand and translate
  * get in touch with your online community manager or community content technology owner to make them aware of the ACCEPT |pre| plug-in (which they can easily download and integrate into the online platform that you are currently using to contribute community content)

If you belong to the second category, you may want to:

  * go to the :ref:`postEditDemos` section to familiarise yourself with the ACCEPT online |post| demos which show how the |post| plug-in can easily be used to make machine-translated content easier to understand
  * get in touch with your online community manager to discuss whether some of your community's textual content could be translated into other languages, using a combination of translation suggestions (possibly provided by machine-translation providers) and editing (provided by yourself according to your proficiency in languages). The ACCEPT Portal allows project managers to create |post| tasks, so you could be assigned some of these small tasks very easily.
  * go to the :ref:`postEditTask` section to familiarise yourself with the ACCEPT |post| plug-in.

If you belong to the third category, you may want to:

  * familiarise yourself with the :ref:`preEditAll`, :ref:`postEditAll`, :ref:`evaluationAll` and :ref:`PortalAll` parts of the documentation. If you are technical, you may want to specifically look into the :ref:`preEditPlugin` and :ref:`postExternalProject` sections to understand better how the plug-ins can be integrated into your own environment. If you are interested in putting a mechanism in place to collect ratings for translated content, you may also want to take a look at an evaluation :ref:`evaluationClientExample`.
  * identify community members who may be interested in authoring their textual content with the |pre| plug-in or conducting |post| tasks. You may need to communicate to these members the value of content editing and find ways to motivate them in using these tools.
