Overview
========

The ACCEPT |post| client (or plug-in) provides a number of editing assistance methods to the user, including:

  * Alternative translation options for specific substrings (e.g. "enhance" instead of "improve" as described in :ref:`json_format`).
  * Interactive language checking (e.g. spelling, grammar, style) suggestion from a third-party provider. Currently the only provider supported is Acrolinx.
  * Paraphrasing: alternative paraphrases generated by a third-party provider. Currently the only service supported is provided by UEDIN and based on `Rephrase <http://rustamli.github.io/rephrase/index.html>`_.
