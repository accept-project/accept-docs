Demos
=====

Six |post| demo projects are available within the ACCEPT Portal. Three of the demos include tasks that can be edited in a collaborative manner. The other three demos include tasks that can be edited independently: |portal-pe-demos|

..    * `English-French <http://www.accept-portal.eu/AcceptPortal/en/PostEdit/ProjectDetail/99>`_
..    * `French-English <http://www.accept-portal.eu/AcceptPortal/en/PostEdit/ProjectDetail/97>`_
..    * `English-German <http://www.accept-portal.eu/AcceptPortal/en/PostEdit/ProjectDetail/98>`_

Each demo project shows how the |post| plug-in can be integrated and used to post-edit machine-translated text. For more information on the |post| plug-in's features, refer to its contextual help.


.. The |post| window has two parts: the left hand-side contains machine-translated text, which consists of multiple sentences. Each of these sentences may be improved with post-editing. The right hand-side of the window contains the :guilabel:`Current sentence to edit` box, which allows a machine-translated sentence to be post-edited by possibly following the guidelines that are made available via the :guilabel:`Guidelines` button. There are three buttons below the :guilabel:`Current sentence to edit` box: an :guilabel:`Undo` button, a :guilabel:`Redo` button, and a spelling and grammar check button.

.. For each sentence, comments may be added in the :guilabel:`Comments` text area, but this is purely optional. Comments and changes are saved automatically. It is possible to navigate from one sentence to another in two ways: by clicking on any sentence on the left hand-side or by using the :guilabel:`Prev` and :guilabel:`Next` buttons to move one sentence at a time.

.. Clicking :guilabel:`Save for Later` allows for activity to continue the next time the task is opened, until :guilabel:`Complete Task` is eventually clicked.
