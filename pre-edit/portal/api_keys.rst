Creating an API key
===================

In order to use the ACCEPT plug-in outside of the ACCEPT Portal, you need an API Key. To generate an API key you need to create an application from the |pre| menu.

To generate an API key, click on :guilabel:`Create new Application` and fill in the form.

If everything goes well your new application is listed in your profile details. To get the API key just click in the application name and the API details will be displayed along with your API Key.

.. note:: Keep in mind that each API key will be associated with the IP address where you intend to install the ACCEPT plug-in.
