Demos
=====

Three |pre| demo pages are available within the ACCEPT Portal, one for each source language: |portal-pre-demos|

..    * `English <http://www.accept-portal.eu/AcceptPortal/en/Demo/English>`_
..    * `French <http://www.accept-portal.eu/AcceptPortal/en/Demo/French>`_
..   * `German <http://www.accept-portal.eu/AcceptPortal/en/Demo/German>`_

Each demo page shows how the |pre| plug-in works in a `TinyMCE <http://www.tinymce.com/>`_ environment by offering language checking.

Once you have typed or pasted some text into the text area, the checking functionality might be available in two ways: by clicking the ABC button (in the TinyMCE toolbar) and by right-clicking the text area. The latter option allows you to select any type of check, while the former performs all check types. Depending on the language of your input text, you might also be able to trigger checks in a sequential manner using multiple rule sets.
