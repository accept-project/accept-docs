Overview
========

The ACCEPT |pre| plug-in can be used to improve the quality of text entered by your users.
It provides several capabilities including spelling, grammar and style corrections.

There are several reasons why this may be useful to you:

* Help your users improve the quality of their submissions.
  This can help them receive better responses from other users. This is especially useful if they are asking questions.
* Help non-native speakers submit quality English submissions
* If you wish to use machine translation to provide translations in other languages, improving the quality of the text can lead to better machine translated content.

The ACCEPT |pre| plug-in has been designed so that it can be integrated into any Web based application with a minimum of effort and the focus has been on providing a solution that can be used with ANY input area.
